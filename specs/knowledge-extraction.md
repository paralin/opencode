# Knowledge Extraction Feature Architecture

## Overview

The knowledge extraction feature is triggered during session compaction (when context exceeds model limits). It extracts valuable, reusable information from sessions and persists it for future use.

## Configuration

Located in `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`, the compaction config schema includes:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `extract_knowledge` | boolean | false | Extract and persist knowledge when compacting sessions |
| `cleanup_transcripts` | boolean | true | Remove transcript files after extraction |
| `auto_load_knowledge` | boolean | false | Automatically load all knowledge files into system prompt |

## Directory Structure

```
.opencode/
  sess/           # Session transcripts (exported before extraction)
  knowledge/      # Extracted knowledge files (*.md with frontmatter)
```

## Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/session/knowledge.ts` | Main orchestration - `SessionKnowledge.extract()`, `list()`, `load()`, `ensureDirectories()`, `parseKnowledgeReferences()` |
| `src/session/prompt/knowledge-extractor.txt` | System prompt defining what to extract and output format |
| `src/session/export.ts` | `SessionExport.toMarkdown()` and `writeToFile()` for transcript export |
| `src/session/compaction.ts` | Integration point - calls knowledge extraction during compaction |
| `src/session/system.ts` | `SystemPrompt.knowledge()` - loads knowledge files into context |
| `src/session/prompt.ts` | `extractKnowledgeReferences()` - parses `<knowledge_references>` blocks from summaries |
| `src/agent/agent.ts` | Built-in `knowledge-extractor` agent definition |

## Flow

1. Session transcript exported to `.opencode/sess/<session-id>.md`
2. `knowledge-extractor` agent analyzes transcript
3. Knowledge saved to `.opencode/knowledge/*.md` with frontmatter
4. Knowledge file paths included in compacted summary via `<knowledge_references>` blocks
5. On future prompts, referenced files loaded into system prompt

## Knowledge-Extractor Agent

Defined in `src/agent/agent.ts` with:
- **Tools**: read, write, edit, glob, grep (task, bash, webfetch disabled)
- **Permissions**: edit allowed, bash/webfetch denied
- **Prompt**: Loaded from `knowledge-extractor.txt`

## What Gets Extracted

- Design decisions and architectural choices
- Technical specifications and schemas
- Bug resolutions and root causes
- Codebase learnings and patterns
- User preferences and coding style

## What is NOT Extracted

- Step-by-step debugging logs
- Raw tool outputs
- Verbose code dumps
- Transient discussion
- Routine operations
